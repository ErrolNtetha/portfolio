# Just a Little Story

I think any developer can relate to those days when you feel fired up and excited to begin a new project, then you work on it instantly, and then in the middle of it all you start putting less and less effort than you did at the beginning. A new framework or idea has captured your attention, and you feel tempted to start working on it. Guess what? You do just that. You get started with another project and with the last one left unfinished. The process goes on and on and on. 

This is the website i thought will be my portfolio site where i host my work and progress. I build this website a year ago, 2020, when i was getting my feet wet on the ReactJS library. 
I felt so excited going into it, and then because learning new stuff is joy for me, i kept coming up with much more "seem-to-be" interesting ideas and stuff, then i just got started and had to abandoned this website but with the hope of returning to it soon, and as you can relate, i didn't. But though, one of the biggest reason i had to take a small break from coding was really my exams which were about to take place later in that month.

This is my portfolio website i tried creating last year when i was transitioning to Web Development after i have worked with Graphic Design work for months. 

It all started with learning HTML and CSS then React a little bit. During the days of learning HTML and CSS it felt good and became a hobby that i would hit the keyboard coding through the night and not regretting anything. I started to enjoy programming more than any career i have ever came to know. It went on and on until i got into it which made me even more curious to learn a Library like React. At that time, i was using classes as yu might noticed it classed-based. Then now i am learning Hooks because i found them to be much more comprehensive than classes.
