This is my portfolio website i tried creating last year when i was transitioning to Web Development after a i have worked with Graphic Design work for months. 

It all started with learning HTML and CSS then React a little bit. During the days of learning HTML and CSS it felt good and became a hobby that i would hit the keyboard coding through night and not regretting anything. I started to enjoy programming more than any career i have ever came to know. It went on and on until i got into it which made me even more curious to learn a Library like React. At that time, i was using classes as yu might noticed it classed-based. Then now i am learning Hooks because i found them to be much more comprehensive than classes.
